 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/v1.api.coepi.org/fullchain.pem
   Your key file has been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/v1.api.coepi.org/privkey.pem
   Your cert will expire on 2020-07-08. To obtain a new or tweaked
   version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot-auto
   again. To non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run
   "certbot-auto renew"
 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
   making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
